# Image Generators

The goal of this set of projects is to build a neural network that produces various types of images. Each is built upon the last, small and incrementally.

## Sub-Projects Leading to the Major Project

### One Generator

**STATUS**: Complete

I have to start somewhere. The first project here is the "One Generator."

It is built with the goal of producing a picture of the number 1.

### Four Generator

**Status**: Planned

This is the next logical step. This is designed to produce a picture of the number 4.

Why is this the next logical step? Because there are two reasonable ways to write the number 4. In some real sense, we are asking our network to produce one of two random results, and there may be problems with this.

### Digit Generator

**Status**: Planned

This is the final small step. This is designed to produce a picture of a random digit.

This feels like it should be a scaled up version of the Four Generator, but there may be new issues that arise.

### Dataset Acquisition

**Status**: Unplanned - Considering Reasonable Datasets to Acquire

### Actual Art Generation

**Status**: Unplanned - Considering Reasonable Datasets to Acquire
